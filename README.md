# Personal Website built entirely with Python and served via Streamlit and hosted using Heroku


From creating my own personal website in Python from scratch and used Streamlit library to deploy it. I have hosted this website on Heroku.

Fun things about this project:
 
 * True to being a data scientist I wanted to work on a project where I could do all of the programming needed in python and then also deploy it.
 
 * Thus giving myself the opportunity of running the entire life cyle of a project
 
 * So I created this fun project buliding a webapp as my personal website using Steamlit libarary and hosting it on Heroku

Thank you for stopping by!
